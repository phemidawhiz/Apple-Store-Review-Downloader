# Apple-Store-Review-Downloader
A PHP web application to crawl app reviews on apple store and store them in a downloadable csv file.

HOW IT WORK

This app use urls to apple store apps to download some review information on for the apps. The name, review comment, rating and link of every review are properly formatted in a tabular form available for download as a csv file. 

TECHNOLOGY AND CONCEPT
This code module is written in PHP. The API responsible for the project's core uses REST API concept to decode and traverse json provided by Apple API.

USING AND REVIEWING THE CODE

The files are availalable for reviews and contribution here on git hub and can also be downloaded for use. This code can be integrated easily in any existing project.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT AND OPTIMISING
I'm looking forward making the app support reviews from Amazon and Google Play Store. Future Optimisation will include caching and AJAX. Keep your hands on deck!
